# Chat App using C# and TCP/IP protocol


Creating a chat app using C# and TCP/IP protocol can be a rewarding project. Here's a basic outline to get you started:

Design UI: Create a simple UI with text boxes for typing messages and displaying received messages. 💻

Server Setup: Implement a basic server using C# with TCP/IP, using TcpListener to accept connections. 🛠️

Client-Server Communication: Define a simple message protocol (e.g., newline terminated messages) and implement sending/receiving messages on both client and server. 📡

Handle Multiple Clients: Manage multiple client connections using threads/tasks on the server side and maintain a list of connected clients. 🤝

Add Basic Features: Implement message broadcasting to all connected clients and display received messages on the client side. 📨

Error Handling: Add basic error handling for network errors and unexpected disconnects. ⚠️

Testing: Test the app to ensure basic functionality such as sending/receiving messages and handling multiple clients. 🧪

Deployment: Deploy the app for testing on local networks or distribute it to users with clear instructions. 🚀
